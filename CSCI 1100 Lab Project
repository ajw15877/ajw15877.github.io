<h1><font color="grey">Broderick Jones:OT</h1></font>
<img src="broderick_jones.jpg" height="200" width="320"></img>
<p>
<font size="3">Broderick Jones is a 5 Star Offensive Tackle from Lithonia High School in Lithonia, Georgia. Broderick Jones is ranked number 19 nationally; he is also the number 2 ranked Offensive Tackle and the number 3 ranked player in the state of Georgia. He has a balanced skill set of pass blocking and run blocking, while also possessing quality strength and quickness and body control that is hard to find in linemen his size. According to 247Sports, Broderick Jones is 6 foot 5 inches and 275 pounds; which makes me compare his size and play to UGA Junior Offensive Tackle, Andrew Thomas. Andrew Thomas is 6 foot 5 inches and 320 pounds, once Jones gets to UGA and starts their strength and conditioning routine he should gain the extra 45 pounds or so, and plays really aggressive and is able to bully anyone in front of him in the run game and uses his quickness, size and athleticism to defeat edge players that use finesse or power in the passing game.</font>

<h1><font color="grey">Carson Beck:QB</h1></font>
<img src="carson_beck.jpg" height="200" width="400"></img>
<p>
<font size="3">Carson Beck is a 4 star Quarterback from Mandarin High School in Jacksonville, Florida. Carson Beck is ranked number 60 nationally, number 3 in PRO style Quarterback, and number 7 in Florida. In 2018 he completed 209 passes out of 356 to give him a total of 3546 passing yards, 39 passing touchdowns, and 8 interceptions. With those numbers, he had a 58.7% completion rating and averaged around 10 yards per attempt or 17 yards per completion. According to those numbers, he’ll throw an interception for every 5 touchdowns that he throws. Carson Beck’s 2018 stats compare to Aaron Murray’s UGA career stats. Aaron Murray completed 921 passes out of 1478, averaging 230 out of 370 passes per season. Aaron Murray also had an average of 30 passing touchdowns and 10 interceptions, and averaged 9 yards per attempt or 14 yards per completion. Carson Beck is also almost 6 foot 5 inches and 226 pounds which gives him an advantage while he is throwing from the pocket because he isn’t too much shorter than the taller offensive linemen.</font>

<img src="arik_gilbert.jpg" height="200" width"240"></img>

His size and speed is most comparable to Eric Ebron, who is 6 foot 4 and 250 pounds and runs a 4.60 second 40.In the 2014 draft, Eric Ebron was drafted number 10 overall by the Detroit Lions, which was the first tight end to be drafted in 2014.
